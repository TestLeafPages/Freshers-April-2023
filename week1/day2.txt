What is a Class?
 A class is a  group of object which have common properties. It is a blueprint or template from which object are created. A java class can contains  fiels, methods , Constructor and block of code.

What is an Object?
  An object is Instance of a class.
  It is a Realtime entity or real world entity.
Syntax for Object:
ClassName objectName=new ClassName();

What are the naming Conventions to followed while creating java class?
  Pascal Notations:
    ClassName--> Starting first letter should be capital , when we have multiple words each words should start with uppercase.

CamelCase:
    methodName, variableName, objectName---> starting first letter with lowercase,
when we have multiple words second word onward init should be capital.

Syntax for class:
     public class FirstProgram{
             ------block of code-----
             ------------
               }

 public -- Access Modifier
 class --- Keyword
 FirstProgram -- name of the class

Syntax for method:
     public void addTwoNumber(){
     --------block of code------------
     -----------------
}
     
public -- Access Modifier
void   --- Return type
addTwoNumber -- name of the method

Syntax for Object:
ClassName objectName=new ClassName();


Explain main method?

	Main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. The syntax of main method ispublic static void main(String args[]). 

public : Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be access by any Class.

static : It is a keyword, it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.

void : void is return type, here does not return anything.

main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only.

Difference between Local Variable and Global Variable?
Local Variable                                Global Variable
If you are declaring the variables      If you are declaring the variables
inside a method, That is called as      inside a class, and outside of the method
Local Variable                          That is called as Global variable.

should be Initialized                   May or may not be Initialized

if you are declaring the local          if you are declaring the Global
variable, it will be accessing only     variable, it will be accessing any where of
with in a method, but it can not         this class.
accessed outside the method.

For local variable access modifier     For Global variable access modifier
can't be used.                         can be used.

Access Modifiers:
public  -- Access from any where of the project
private  -- Access only  with in a class
protected --- Access from  with in package , we can able to access outside of the package but the class should be inherited
default  -- Access only with in a package
